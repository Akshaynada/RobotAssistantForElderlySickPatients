Objective:
----------
The main objective of our project “Robot Assistant for Elderly Per-
son / Patient” is to help the people with motor impairments to pick the
everyday objects for their daily use using our Simple, Inexpensive Robot.
The general objective can be broken down to four more specific objectives
that would together achieve the overall goal of the project as follows:

1. To build a Android Mobile Application. This will be available to
our user, to request the fetching of a particular object present in his/her
room.

2. To study and develop a generic, automated and intelligent system which
can process the user request command, initiate the required hardware
and their functionalities and detect the requested Object from a
current image of the room using the Surface feature detection algorithm.
3. To study and develop a smart system which can correlate the real
time dimension of the room and represent the real time dimension into
“Digital Mapping System”.

4. To build an Inexpensive, Simple, Wireless Robot which can re-
ceive the routing Instruction from the Server Systems mentioned
above. Robot should be able to follow the path specified by sys-
tem and pick the object requested and then give the same to the
requested user.

Our Solution
------------

Our project “Robot Assistant for Elderly Person / Patient” con-
tains, A Server system which processes the Tap button command given by
a patient or a person and recognize the object they are requesting using a
currently captured image of his/her room, that will be scanned for that Re-
quested object. Its location is sent to a robot which follow the path given
by the Server System and robot will pick the same object and give it to the
patient.

• There are few Robot Which does similar operations but they have
built in Processors, Camera, Microphone, Sensors and other required
hardware installed in them and they cost in kilos of dollars but

• Our project is Remote-Server based system where all the complex and
high processing operations are done by a laptop or Desktop and as a
output set of routing data is sent to the Robot.

• Since most of them own a laptop or desktop the cost of Resources
reduced and the Robot we are using need not to have higher Processor
or RAM, all it just need few micro-controller which take the data from
receiver and move the wheels towards object and pick the object and
give it to user.

• The above idea and techniques reduces the cost of the Robot and can
make available to the public easily.

Front End Operations
--------------------

•A wireless User Interface installed near the patients bed or resting place
which triggers a request to a needed object and sends that request to
Server System.

• A wired/wireless Camera installed in his room, which is fixed in a
particular location and helps the Server System to locate the objects.

• A Basic Modelled Robot with RF (Radio Frequency) receiver, which
just accept the routing information from the Server System via RF
transmitter. Information contains the route from robot to particular
object and from there to patients location.

• Robot should be capable of holding the objects.

Backend Operations
------------------

• Server System can be any computational device which has the capable
processor to process image and communication media to send informa-
tion.

• Server can be a Laptop, Desktop with RF Transmitter.

• Command received from the Keypad is processed by Server System
which recognizes the object requested by the user.

• System should enable the Camera and capture clear view image of the
Room and process that image for the presence of that object.

• System should prepare the digital map of that environment and if the
object is present, it should prepare a feasible route from robot to objects
location and from there to patient.

• Server System will send the routing direction to the robot which follow
the route and pick the object and give it to the user.

Overall operation of the project involve the proper synchronization of the
elements of both back-end and front-end.
Problem domains are Image processing, Intelligent Digital Mapping and
Robotics.
